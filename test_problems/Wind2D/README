---------------------------------------------------------------------
Test problem for 2D stellar wind simulations, using axisymmetry and
a nested grid (static mesh-refinement).
---------------------------------------------------------------------

This simulates a spherically symmetric wind expanding at 1500 km/s
with mass-injection rate of 1e-7 Msun/year, corresponding roughly to
an O star of 20-30 Msun.

There is no chemistry or cooling, so the shocked regions evolve
adiabatically, with EOS gamma=5/3.

The system evolves in a cylindrical domain of approxmately 1 parsec
radius and 2 parsec in height, and the outer shock reaches the
boundary after about 50,000 years, at which point the simulation
stops.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

The parameter files "params_Wind2D_nXXXX_lY.txt" use different spatial
resolution and different numbers of nested-grid levels, where only
half of the full space is simulated, with reflecting boundary
conditions imposed at the equator.

- The files with "n0128" have 128x128 grid zones per level, and those
with "n0256" have 256 grid zones per level.

- "Y" refers to the number of refinement levels.

- The n0128 setups have an inner wind-boundary at radius 1.543e17 cm,
and the n0256 setups have it at radius 0.75e17 cm (i.e. about 2x
smaller).

- These simulations can be run with a single core using "run.sh"


---------------------------------------------------------------------

The parameter files "params_Wind2Dhp_nXXXX_lY.txt" are the same
except that the full space is simulated, so they will take twice as
long to run.

- These simulations can be run with a single core using "run_hp.sh"

---------------------------------------------------------------------

* Default solver is 4: the Roe Conserved Variable solver.

* Default viscosity setting is 4: using the H-correction together
with the 1D viscosity of Falle et al. (1998).

* This is the slowest setting: PION could run significantly faster
with solver=6 and AVtype=1.

* A colour tracer variable is used to track the mixing of wind and
ISM material.
