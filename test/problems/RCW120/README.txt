"Wind bubbles within HII regions around slowly moving stars"

Note that parameter files have been updated to work with latest version of PION, and will likely no longer work with the original version.

(1) param_RCW120_HIIR.txt
This calculates the HII region around a source moving with 4 km/s through a uniform ISM.

(2) param_RCW120_WindHIIR.txt
This calculates the Wind bubble and HII region around a source moving with 4 km/s through a uniform ISM.

(3) param_RCW120_WindHIIR_l2.txt
Same as (2) above, but with two levels of refinement and lower resolution in the coarsest grid (so it should run significantly faster for equivalent results).
