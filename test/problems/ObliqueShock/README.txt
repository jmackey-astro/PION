This test sets up an almost--grid--aligned shock, both Mach 25 and 40,
on a 2D slab-symmetric grid.  The shock is subject to the Quirk
instability, and one-dimensional viscosity treatments usually fail.
The H-correction fixes the instability very well.

So the only result of the test is that the H-correction successfully
smoothes out the instability which can develop.
