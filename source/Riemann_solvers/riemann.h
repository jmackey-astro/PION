/// Written 2006-11-09-Thurssday
/// Modified :2006-12-20 Testing for linear solver added.
///           2007-01-12 Lots more testing added; linearOK() changed.
///
/// This is a Hydrodynamics Riemann Solver for the Euler Equations.
/// It works by first calling a linear solver, and if the results
/// are within certain tolerances it returns the answer, but if not
/// it calls an exact solver and returns the result from that.
///
/// Modifications:
///  - 2006-06-27 Changed counters to long ints, so there'e no wrap-around.
///  - 2007-07-13 New Functions: SetDirection() and SetAvgState()
///  - 2009-10-20 Split hydro and MHD solver, and put them in a new class
///  heirarchy.
/// - 2010.12.23 JM: Moved to Riemann_solver/ directory.  Moved MHD
///   enums to riemannMHD.h.  Got rid of riemann_base class from
///   eqns_bsae.h so that these don't derive from it.  Got rid of the
///   inherited data arrays RS_pstar/left/right since they have caused
///   bugs.
/// - 2011.03.03 JM: Added rs_nvar=5 for local state vectors.  New code versions
///    can handle up to 70 tracers, so it would hugely slow down the code if the
///    Riemann solver used all that memory when it only needs 5 vars.  Tracer
///    fluxes are dealt with by the flux-solver classes.

/// \brief Hydrodynamics Riemann Solver.
///
/// This class solves the Riemann Problem for the Euler Equations in
/// 1, 2, or 3D.  (It is always a 1D problem, but the other dimensions
/// can be added in and can vary across the contact discontinuity).
///
/// The linear solver is based on Toro (1993)
/// and Falle, Komissarov \& Joarder (1998), and is simple and fast.  I think
/// it would be classes as a Roe-type solver, but it doesn't use the Roe
/// averaging.
///
/// The exact solver  is base on an idea Andy had (which I think he uses
/// for his exact MHD solver).  You have the left and right states, and make
/// a guess for the resolved state pressure.  With this you calculate the
/// resolved state velocity from the left and right waves respectively, and
/// iterate until these velocities match.  Then you have the resolved state
/// and can calculate the wave locations to get the state at x=0.
///
/// References:\n
/// Toro, E.F., 1993, in 'Numerical Methods for Fluid Dynamics 4'
/// (Oxford, U.K.: Clarendon Press), Eds. M.J. Baines & K.W. Morton, p.375.\n
/// Falle, S.A.E.G., Komissarov, S.S., & Joarder, P., 1998, M.N.R.A.S., 297,

///
/// \note
/// This class is designed for single-threaded programming.  It is set
/// up at the start of a simulation, and then called many times in sequence
/// to solve riemann problems between grid cells.  It has no checking to make
/// sure it is not already doing a solve when a new solve is called.
///
/// \section Mode
/// I have a switch in the constructor to say
/// if you want it to always use a linear solver, or always an exact solver, or
/// a combination solver (linear for the easy problems, and exact for the hard
/// ones).  So:
///  - Mode 1 : Always Linear Solves.
///  - Mode 2 : Always Exact Solves.
///  - Mode 3 : Always a combination.
///
/// As far as I can tell, the difference in shock tube problems between all
/// these modes is small, of the order of one percent.
