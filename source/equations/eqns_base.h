/// Modifications:
///  - 2007-10-16 Moved equations classes from global.h into this file.
///  - 2009-10-20 Changed name to eqns_base.h and moved euler and mhd equations
///  to other files.
///  - 2009-12-19 JM: Added MaxSpeed() function.
///  - 2010.09.30 JM: Worked on Lapidus AV: added Cl,Cr pointers to flux
///     functions for base solver class.
/// - 2010.11.15 JM: Renamed calculate_flux() to inviscid_flux() and
///   moved AV calculation to FV_solver_base class.
///  - 2010.11.19 JM: Added H-correction eta variable to flux solver.
/// - 2010.12.23 JM: Removed riemann_base.  Moved SetAvgState to
///   eqns_base class.  Renamed RS_meanvec to eq_meanvec.
///   Moved flux_solver_base class to flux_base.h
/// - 2011.01.03 JM: Added eq_posdir and eq_negdir direction variables.
/// - 2015.08.03 JM: Added pion_flt for double* arrays (allow floats)
/// - 2018.01.24 JM: worked on making SimPM non-global
