/// Microphysics base class, from which all microphysics classes are
/// derived.  This defines the interface between the microphysics
/// class and the rest of the simulation code.
///
/// - 2011.02.25 JM: removed NEW_RT_MP_INTERFACE ifdef (it is assumed now)
/// - 2011.03.16 JM: Added TimeUpdateMP_RTnew() function to integrate the rate
/// equations
///     NOT in the C2Ray way.  i.e. I assume the timestep is short enough that
///     the instantaneous optical depth is a good enough approximation to the
///     time-averaged optical depth.
/// - 2011.03.21 JM: Updated  RTnew() interface for more sources.  It is now
/// simpler.
/// - 2011.05.02 JM: Added set_multifreq_source_properties() function
/// - 2012.01.16 JM: Tabbing.
/// - 2013.08.12 JM: added get_recombination_rate() public function.
/// - 2013.08.19 JM: added get_th_xsection() public function.
/// - 2013.08.20 JM: Added NTau var to rt_source_data, Column and
///    DelCol are changed to arrays.  Added get_n_el() function.
/// - 2014.09.22 JM: Added  total_cooling_rate() function to get the
///    cooling rates per cell for postprocessing.
/// - 2015.07.16 JM: added pion_flt datatype (double or float).
/// - 2015.08.03 JM: Added pion_flt for double* arrays (allow floats)
/// - 2018.01.25 JM: added functions to request n(H+),n(H0),n(e-)
