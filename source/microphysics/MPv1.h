/// \description
/// This microphysics class was used in Mackey & Lim (2010,2011) for
/// studying the expansion of HII regions and the formation of
/// pillars, globules, elephant trunks at the borders of HII regions.
/// It uses a modified version of the C2-ray algorithm developed by
/// G.Mellema and collaborators (Mellema et al., 2006).
/// It has since been superseded by updated algorithms that scale
/// better on supercomputers (see Mackey, 2012, A&A).
///
/// Modifications:
///  - 2007-12-17 Started File with CoolingFn, UpdateMicroPhysics classes.
///  - 2008-01-21 Moved Cooling to its own file.  updated interface.
///  - 2010-01-05 JM: Added public function for getting microphysics timescales
///      for heating/cooling/recombination etc.
/// - 2010-04-10 JM: Added flag for Raga's recombination rates (not
///     used at the moment)
///
/// - 2011.02.25 JM: removed NEW_RT_MP_INTERFACE ifdef (it is assumed now)
/// - 2011.03.23 JM: Added new interface functions (they are just placeholders
/// for now).
/// - 2013.08.12 JM: added get_recombination_rate() public function.
/// - 2015.07.07 JM: New trtype array structure in constructor.
/// - 2015.07.16 JM: added pion_flt datatype (double or float).
/// - 2015.08.05 JM: tidied up code; added pion_flt datatype.
/// - 2018.03.20 JM: Renamed file.
