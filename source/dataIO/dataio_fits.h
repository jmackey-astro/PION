/// This file is forked off from dataio_base.h
///
/// modified:\n
/// - 2010-02-03 JM: made ~utility_fitsio() virtual function.
/// - 2010-04-21 JM: Changed filename setup so that i can write
///    checkpoint files with fname.999999.txt/silo/fits
/// - 2010-07-20/21 JM: Work on new dataio structure with a list of
///    parameters to read and write.  Made a start.
/// - 2010.07.23 JM: removed obselete read_fits_header(),
///    write_fits_header() functions.
/// - 2010.10.13 JM: Removed NEW_SOLVER_STRUCT ifdefs.
/// - 2011.06.02 JM: Added WriteHeader() function so I can over-write header
///    parameters and restart a simulation with e.g. different microphysics.
/// - 2013.04.16 JM: choose_filename() made public.
/// - 2015.01.28 JM: Tidied up, added "virtual" to some functions.
/// - 2018.01.24 JM: worked on making SimPM non-global
